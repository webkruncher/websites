		This site is powered by the InformationKruncher's KrunchServer.  The goal of this project is 
		to design a service that meets the following criteria:
		<li>Built purely using international standards</li>
		<li>Is extensible</li>
		<li>Is fault tolerant, and secure</li>
		<li>Works the same in every <b>standard</b> operating environment</li>
		<li>Must be legible, and designed to accomadate the needs of any competent computer programmer.</li>
	</p>

	<p>
		Certain features found in many mainstream product lines, that are not a goal of the KrunchServer include, but are not limited to:
		<li>Ability to work with systems that are designed to be incompatible with international standards</li>
		<li>Methods to promote any sinkhole of support</li>
		<li>Techniques to hobble the product, or cause it to be dysfunctional in support of forced upgrades or other sales efforts</li>
