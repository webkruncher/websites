				I've been writing software since 1993, almost 
				entirely using international standards.
				Just about every thing I do is built using
				C++ / STL (ISO 14882) and geared toward complete 
				platform independence.

				I try to make sure that everything I write	
				may be easily ported to any mainstream operating 
				system.

				I've worked on a wide variety of projects, and 
				have seen a lot of different styles.  Many projects
				depend on systems that are built using proprietary
				libraries, and some depend on operating systems
				that are designed to not follow standards.  But,
				even in the worst case scenario, standards based
				code is easy to port.  Building solid solutions
				is a matter of using solid design principles.

				Most of the time, solutions to complex problems 
				can be solved with generic methods.  A web server
				is a good example.  Servers are complicated, and
				must answer some difficult problems, but
				a server that can only suit the needs of one
				program is virtually worthless.

				Software is a team effort.  A software engineer
				may be highly skilled, and understand software
				design completely, but get nowhere without the
				support of many other talents.

				In my opinion, the best approach is to have a 
				good attitude, and find productive environments.
				Teams that work well together get things done.
