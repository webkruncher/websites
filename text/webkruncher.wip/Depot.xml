			I'm building a set of utilities for use with 
			orthodox computer systems.  The project is based strictly on 
			ISO 14882, and is designed to be infinitely extensible.
		</p>
		<p>
			All components of the project are built to be platform 
			independant, and should operate the same regardless of the 
			operating system.
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently, the programs consist of two major sections.

			<li>ExecutableXML</li>
			<li>KrunchServer</li>
