			Thank you for visiting my hobby site.  
		</p>
		<p> 
			<div style="display:inline">This site runs on my own, custom built</div>
			<div 
				style="cursor:pointer;display:inline; color:teal;"
				onmouseover="this.style.color='blue'"
				onmouseout="this.style.color='black'"
				onclick="Navigate('KrunchServer.Details')" >
				web server
			</div>.  
			<div style="display:inline">
			All of the client side script is 
			home made, and the only software used is the operating system, the standard 
			tool-chain, and a few custom source files.</div>
		</p>
		<p> 
			International standards power the internet.  The information super highway
			is a product of thousands of engineers, and millions of users.  No
			software maker deserves credit for inventing it, and nobody owns it.	
		</p>
		<p>
			The web server that powers this web site is designed using pure C++.
			The server is designed to be portable.  The same source code that runs
			on my BSD and Linux systems could run on any other standards based system.
			Most of the tools used will run on any operating system.
