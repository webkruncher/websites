				Software development depends on patterns.  Sparky exhibits a pattern that is frequently used in software design.  
				Sparky was born in 2006, but the algorithms are ancient.

				If you choose to feed Sparky, please be advised, he grows very quickly.  If you feed him more than a couple of nibbles, your cpu may not be powerful enough to accommodate his computationally expensive ways.  This might drive sparky crazy.
				If you starve him, he might die.

				In the world of computer programming, there is no magic pixie dust.  However, a little understanding can go a long way.  Sparky demonstrates what might be one of the most powerful concept in software.
