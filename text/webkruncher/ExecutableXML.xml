			Extensible Markup Language, or XML is a well known, 
			internationally accepted way to deal with structured 
			text.  The language is used primarily as a 
			transport mechanism for moving properties and content 
			between endpoints.

			<whitespace />
			<text>is a pure ISO 14882 (C++ / STL) approach 
			for digesting XML content. The library is fully contained in 
			a single header file, and depends only on the 
			Standard Template Library and a few trivial type 
			abstraction definitions.

		</p>
		<p>
			The project offers a unique, but incredibly flexible 
			approach for digesting XML contents into heterogeneous 
			C++ objects.
		</p>
		<p>
			ExecutableXML is adaptable to international standard io 
			streams, and provides a foundation for modeling complex 
			C++ architectures. The xml can describe anything you want.
